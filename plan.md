# ðŸ§­ Revised Execution Plan (Aligned with Cursor)

### Step 1: Graph Restructuring + Light Tracing (Now)

* Modular nodes for:

  * `identify_information_needs`
  * `retrieve_domain_knowledge`
  * `generate_strategy`
  * `explain_rationale`
* Ensure reasoning steps and inputs are logged per node

**What to run:** Simulate with placeholder outputs
**What to send me:** The graph definition + any printed reasoning logs per step

---

### Step 2: Define Heuristics (Then Prompt Logic)

* Codify 3â€“5 rules like:

  * If premium objection â†’ consider deductible change
  * If coverage requested > domain limit â†’ cap or exclude
* Embed these as either:

  * Prompt logic
  * Retrieval targets
  * Or inline rules in `generate_strategy`

**What to run:** Manually trigger logic branches using mock objections
**What to send me:** Example prompt + output where one heuristic is followed

---

### Step 3: Targeted Domain Knowledge

* Populate docs that support the defined heuristics
* Each domain chunk should support 1â€“2 decisions max
* Use structured metadata for easy matching

**What to run:** Retrieval for each heuristic
**What to send me:** Domain chunk used + reasoning log + final strategy

---

### Step 4: Add Few-Shot Examples

* One worked example per major objection type
* Include retrieval references + rationale reasoning
* Inject these into `generate_strategy` prompt

**What to run:** Objection â†’ chunk â†’ strategy
**What to send me:** Before vs. after few-shot output comparison

---

### Step 5: Enhanced Tracing + Validation

* Implement structured logging:

  * Which deal inputs were used
  * Which domain chunks were cited
  * What decision logic was followed
* Optional: scoring or tagging outputs for review

**What to run:** Full trace on several example inputs
**What to send me:** A complete annotated output trace
